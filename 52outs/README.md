# Magic-IOS-App

**This is provides an out system for magician's everyday-performance.**

## Trick Discription

The Magician shows a turned off phone and allows the spectator to think of *any* card in the deck, while holding this imaginary card at the finger tips.
Once the spectator taps the phone, a folded card appears in the phone. Unfolding it reveals the thought of playing card!

### Getting Started

To run the app, make sure to have installed the latest version of [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) on a Mac device/Mac Virtual Environment. 
Clone the repo with the following url: 

```https://github.com/laurentyzheng/Magic-IOS-App.git```

### Specifications

The app works best with larger phones in order to fit the dimensions of a physical playing card, which is `57mm X 89mm`. 
Ipads would also work, but it is not recommended both for the performance aspects and the visual aspects.
