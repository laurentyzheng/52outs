**The application serves as an out system for magician's everyday-performance.**

## Trick Discription

The Magician shows a turned off phone and allows the spectator to think of *any* card in the deck, while holding this imaginary card at the finger tips.
Once the spectator taps the phone, a folded card appears in the phone. Unfolding it reveals the thought of playing card!


### Specifications

The app works best with larger phones in order to fit the dimensions of a physical playing card, which is `57mm X 89mm`. 
Ipads would also work, but it is not recommended both for the performance aspects and the visual aspects.
